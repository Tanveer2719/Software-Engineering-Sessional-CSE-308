-> In this assignment we have used the factory design pattern.
-> We have created an "abstract class" named as car
-> but we decided the subclass that extends this abstract class to decide what type of car we should create
-> then we created another "CarFactory" class to instantiate the respective subclass using the information about the location


******  Advantages of factory method pattern *****
1. Provides approach to code for an interface rather than a implementation
2. It separates the actual implementation from the user
3. It makes our code more robust and extendable
4. Provides abstraction between implementation and client class through inheritance

******** Definition of factory method pattern ********
1. An interface is created to provide the structure of the implementation
2. The Subclass that implements the interface decides what to build
3. There is a factory class that decides which object to instantiate
